# ShikshaManthan  
### A Gamified, Systems-First Program Design Platform for Education NGOs

ShikshaManthan is an intelligent, guided platform that helps education NGOs design **clear, logical, and funder-ready programs** using a structured Logical Framework Approach (LFA). It replaces unstructured planning and “blank page syndrome” with a step-by-step, systems-driven design journey.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Education NGOs often have strong intent and local understanding, but struggle to translate this into **structured, outcome-oriented program designs**. Creating an LFA is usually expert-dependent, time-consuming, and cognitively demanding. As a result, organizations tend to jump directly to activities without clearly defining outcomes, practice changes, or measurable indicators—leading to fragmented and hard-to-scale programs.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of ShikshaManthan is to **democratize high-quality program design** by enabling NGOs to independently build coherent, system-aligned Logical Frameworks without reliance on external consultants.

---

## 🧠 Approach

ShikshaManthan follows a **systems-first, human-centered approach**. Program design is treated as a guided thinking process rather than a form-filling task. Users progress through decisions in the correct conceptual order, ensuring outcomes and system-level practice changes are defined before activities.

AI is used as a **supportive “critical friend”** that highlights gaps in reasoning while keeping all decisions human-led.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology (Short)

Users move through a locked, step-by-step flow:

**Problem → Student Outcome → Success Definition → Stakeholder Mapping → Practice Change → Activities → Indicators**

Logic Gates prevent skipping steps or creating misaligned designs. Real-time AI nudges improve clarity and alignment. The final output is a **review-ready Logical Framework**.

---

## 🎮 User Journey (High Level)

1. Start a new LFA or continue a draft  
2. Set program context (theme, geography, system level)  
3. Define problem and student outcomes  
4. Map stakeholders and practice changes  
5. Design activities and indicators  
6. Review alignment and export the LFA
